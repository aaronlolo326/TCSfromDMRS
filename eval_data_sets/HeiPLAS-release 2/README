This archive contains the HeiPLAS data set (Heidelberg Princeton
Large-Scale Attribute Selection). If you use this data, please cite my
Ph.D. dissertation [1], which also contains the relevant facts and
properties of the data.

The data comprises approx. 1600 adjective-noun phrases together with an
implicit attribute that is invoked in the phrase meaning. The entire set is
split into a development and a test section (HeiPLAS-dev.txt and
HeiPLAS-test.txt).

Attribute annotations have been obtained in a semi-automatic procedure,
based on WordNet glosses and subsequent manual curation. The entire
procedure is also described in [1]. 

As this data is derived from Princeton WordNet 3.0, its use is subject to
the WordNet license (which is included in the LICENSE file).

In all questions you might have about the data or its use, please do not hesitate to
contact me.
